# Odin Recipes

A simple recipe website built as part of **The Odin Project (Foundations)** to practice HTML basics.

## What I built
- A homepage (`index.html`) that links to individual recipe pages
- Three recipe pages with text content and images
- A simple folder structure (`recipes/` and `images/`)

## What I learned
- Writing basic HTML boilerplate and semantic structure
- Using relative links between pages
- Organizing assets (images) and keeping paths consistent
- **Git & GitHub workflow** (this was the hardest part for me): staging, committing, and pushing changes

## Recipes
- Pasta Salad
- Spanish Omelette (Tortilla Española)
- Ground Beef Tacos

## Project status
Completed (Foundations project)

## Next improvements (optional)
- Improve styling with CSS
- Make images responsive
- Add a cleaner layout and typography
