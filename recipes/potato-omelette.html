    <h2>How to make Spanish Omelette</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by peeling and slicing the potatoes into evenly sized slices.</li>
        <li>Place them in a frying pan with enough olive oil to cover them and let them cook gently over medium-low heat for about 30 minutes, 
            stirring occasionally so they don’t stick.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, thinly slice the onion (fine julienne) and cook it in a pan with a little oil and a pinch of salt until soft.</li>
        <li>When the potatoes and onion are ready, remove and set aside, draining off any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl, add the potatoes and onion, season with salt to taste, and let the mixture rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cook (set) the tortilla in a non-stick pan on both sides for about 45 seconds per side. The exact time depends on how runny or set you like it.</li>
